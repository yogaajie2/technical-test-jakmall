## About

Built with React 18 and bootstrapped using Create React App.

Forms are handled using React Hook Form 7, I don't use this library too much so I learned a lot while working this test.

All styling are handled using Styled Components. Again, since I don't have much experience using this library I learned quite a lot from this test.

No other libraries are used. All other components and functions are hand-coded manually.

Although all required functionalities are working properly, due to my limited time available to work on this test I deeply apologize for any unmet requirements, mainly the mobile UI. Writing and building all functions and components from scratch while also using libraries that I have limited exposure with definitely took more time than I have estimated.
