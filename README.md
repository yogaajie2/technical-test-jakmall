## About

Built with React 18 and bootstrapped using Create React App.

Forms are handled using React Hook Form 7, I don't use this library too much so I learned a lot while working this test.

All styling are handled using Styled Components. Again, since I don't have much experience using this library I learned quite a lot from this test.

No other libraries are used. All other components and functions are hand-coded manually.
